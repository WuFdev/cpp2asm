# cpp2asm
A useless bash script for converting c++ code to asmbelly using gcc
# setup
  Install gcc if you have not already.

# usage
  Run the shell script by typing this ``bash main.sh`` and then adding your input file name as the argument.
  Or if you can drag and drop your cpp file onto main.sh that will work (maybe my vm doesnt have a gui).
